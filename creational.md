## Creational Patterns

### Factory method

### Abstract Factory

- same as above

#### Usage

- Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various
families of related products, but you donâ€™t want it to depend on the
concrete classes of those products

- Consider implementing the Abstract Factory when you have a class with
a set of Factory Methods that blur its primary responsibility

#### Cons

- CONS: The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of
new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern
