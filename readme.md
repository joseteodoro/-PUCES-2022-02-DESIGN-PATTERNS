# Design patterns e Frameworks

## Context

First of all, what is a pattern? Recurrent solutions for recurrent problems

### Object oriented programming

- building blocks for OOP: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritance

- bad results: Coupled classes, god classes, huge inheritance chains, tangled code, hyper fine grained O.O.P.

### design pattern reinforcements

- good practices

- design principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI)

- abstractions

- good design choices

### Arguments against design patters

- weak programming languages

- inefficient solutions

- unjustified use

### Most known O.O.P design patterns

- creational, structural and behavioral, and others more than that

## From problems to patterns!

- Ugly-writer.js (god class, confusing and tangled code, duplication, concurrency failure)
