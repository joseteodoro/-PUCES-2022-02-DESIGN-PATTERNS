# Design patterns e Frameworks

## Context

First of all, what is a pattern? Recurrent solutions for recurrent problems

### Object oriented programming

- building blocks for OOP: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritance

- bad results: Coupled classes, god classes, huge inheritance chains, tangled code, hyper fine grained O.O.P.

Some concurrency review to avoid patterns caveats:

Let's start taking a look on good practices that reinforces the patterns:

Now, let's take a look on patterns by usage (from commonly-used to less commonly-used):

### Patterns by categories

[Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/joseteodoro/PUCES-2021-FEB-DESIGN-PATTERNS/blob/main/creational.md)

[Behavioral Design Patterns](https://github.com/joseteodoro/PUCES-2021-FEB-DESIGN-PATTERNS/blob/main/behavioral.md)

[Structural Design Patterns](https://github.com/joseteodoro/PUCES-2021-FEB-DESIGN-PATTERNS/blob/main/structural.md)

A pattern to help with progressive rollouts with no downtime:
